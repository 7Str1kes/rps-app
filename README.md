# Rock, Paper, Scissors 🧱📄✂️

A simple web-based Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS) game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🎮 How the game works

- The player selects **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.
- The bot randomly picks one of the three options.
- The game compares the choices and shows the result:
  - Rock beats Scissors
  - Scissors beats Paper
  - Paper beats Rock
  - If both choose the same, it's a tie.
